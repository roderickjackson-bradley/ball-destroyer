# Ball Abiding Citizen

## What This Game About

You as the player play as a ball who is a law abiding citizen just living life where all the sudden your world is tuned upside down by events that are known to you... Mysterious.... I know right.

The game is a side scrolling game that uses the following tech stack

- HTML 5 2D
- CSS
- JS
- Canvas
- P2.js

The magic and heavy lifting of the game comes from the HTML 5 2D lib and the P2.js lib, which is my physics machine.

### TODO

1. Set up basic file structure && Boilerplate code.
2. Create Level Map
